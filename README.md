# Predicting Crimes in the US
## Team member: Bibata Rabba Idi, Fatima Javid, JianHui (Jake) Li

### Project Description:
We will be using the Crimes in US Communities dataset to predict the crime rate in each US community. We will also try to find which demographic factors affect the crime rate the most in each community. The input would be the demographics of each community such as income, race percentages, age percentages, rent prices, education levels, etc. The output would be the type of crime or we could group all the crime rate columns and just use the total number of crimes as the output.

The Crimes in US Communities dataset provides 146 variables that allow us to test and understand which categorical factors impact crime rates. The dataset is from 2018 and includes information about US communities such as population, age, race, income, types of crimes, and overall crime rates.
