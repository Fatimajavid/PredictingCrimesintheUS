### Project Description:
We will be using the Crimes in US Communities dataset to predict the crime rate in each US community. We will find out which demographic factors affect the crime rate the most in each community. The input would be the demographics of each community such as income, age percentages, rent prices, education levels, etc. The output would be the total number of crimes or each type of crime separately.
